# Python-RPG-game
I wanted to just mess around with some code. so i decided to make a little choice adventure game.
The game story doesnt really matter but the basic run down of the code is just a couple while statements, loads of prints and inputs from the player.
Very very simple.
I wanted to make the code a bit more interesting and make the game actually fun to play. it isnt finished yet, but anyone who is interested can just have a play. 
Any suggestions on what i can do to make it faster or anything like that would be great.
Had some ideas that would be awesome if someone knows how to implement.
1- Background music. i want the game to have some flavour in the background that makes it more fun to play.
2- ways to navigate around the story easier. like a way for the user to just jump straight to a point in the story?
3- A way to make the achievents actually work, like they are only displayed if you have achieved them or something.
4- A way to make it easier to change the story or add story faster.

many thanks if anyone responds. i know it is very basic code but i want to get into this and would really appreciate any help! :D
